### Client Application

More information about the client are in the `client/README.md`. Make sure you read them.

Using the provided UI components, implement the following modifications, bugfixes or new features (you can decide in what order):

#### Bugs

-   [x] **B1**: `List` content
    -   Fix the content alignment of the non-empty `List` component.
-   [x] **B2**: `Footer` alignment
    -   Fix the `Layout` component so the `Footer` is always attached to the bottom of the `Layout`.

_Fix all other bugs and visual imperfections you find._

#### Features

-   [x] **F1**: Default values in `Footer`
    -   Modify the counters in `Footer` to show 0 when no value(s) are passed.
-   [x] **F2**: Load todo items
    -   After opening the application, todo items should be loaded from the server
    -   The todo items should be displayed in the `List` component.
-   [ ] **F3**: Add a todo item
    -   Implement logic, which toggles visibility between the "add" button in the `Header` and a `Form` component.
    -   Entering a value inside the `Form` component and submitting it should create a new todo item.
    -   Data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
-   [ ] **F4**: Edit a todo item's label
    -   Implement logic, which toggles visibility between the "edit" button in the `ListItem` and a `Form` component.
    -   Entering a value inside the `Form` component and submitting it should edit the existing todo item.
    -   Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
-   [ ] **F5**: Complete a todo item
    -   After clicking on the checkbox in the `ListItem`, the todo item should toggle between "done" and "todo" states.
    -   Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
-   [ ] **F6**: Delete a todo item
    -   After clicking the "delete" button in the `ListItem`, the todo item should be deleted.
    -   Changes to the data should be persisted on the server via an API call.
-   [ ] **F7**: Sort the todo items
    -   Sort the list of the todo items:
        -   "todo" items (not "done") should be displayed first,
        -   after that, items should be sorted by their creation date, descending.
-   [ ] **F8**: Count the todo items
    -   Show a number of the "todo"/"done" items in the `Footer`.
-   [ ] **F9**: `Button` component
    -   Create a `Button` component and use it instead of HTML `button` elements.

#### Styling

-   [ ] **UI1**: `Header` "add" button alignment
    -   The "add" button should be aligned to the right in the `Header` component.
-   [ ] **UI2**: `ListItem` actions alignment
    -   Action buttons in the `ListItem` component should be aligned to the right.
-   [ ] **UI3**: `ListItem` actions visibility
    -   Action buttons in the `ListItem` component should be visible only when hovering over the `ListItem`.

#### Stories (optional tasks)

-   [ ] **SB1**: Add a story/stories for the `Layout` component.
-   [ ] **SB2**: Add stories showing available `Button` variants.
-   [ ] **SB3**: Add a story showcasing the `ListItem` actions visibility change on hover (implemented in _"UI3"_).

### Server

-   [ ] **S1**: Implement a custom endpoint for marking single todo item as "done". Calling this endpoint sets the `done` field to `true` and the `finishedAt` field to current time. Use this new endpoint in the client.

## Additional Comments

-   Feel free to do any visual modifications that - in your opinion - improve the design of the application.
-   Feel free to install and use any public package you may need.

### GitHub

-   Do your best to use atomic commits.
-   In each commit that solves (fully or partly) one of the tasks above, add the task's id into the commit message. For example: _"B1: fix typo in ..."_.

### Storybook

-   We use the Storybook's format CSF3, but you can use the older version of the CSF format if you are more familiar with it.
